Below is an editor where you can try writing a query yourself.

The query below tells noodle to go to the google search result for 
JavaScript and expect a html file. Then using the selector pick out 
all of the result anchors. Finally the query says to extract the 
text for each of those anchor elements.

Press run below to see the output:

    var query = {
        url: 'http://google.com/search?q=javascript',
        type: 'html',
        selector: 'h3.r a',
        extract: 'text'
      },
      uriQuery = encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify(query)),
      request  = 'http://example.noodlejs.com/?q=' +
                 uriQuery + '&callback=?';

    // Make Ajax request to Noodle server
    jQuery.getJSON(request, function (data) {
      alert(data[0].results);
    });

Noodle queries don't just support html but also json, feeds and plain xml. They  can be a lot more powerful too.
